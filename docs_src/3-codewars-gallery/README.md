> “ First, solve the problem. Then, write the code. ”  - _John Johnson_

In this project you will send you deep into [problem solving and thinking with code](http://elewa.education/2018/01/22/thinking-computer-thoughts/).  Rather than doing as many exercises as possible, you'll be doing an in-depth study of at least 10 exercises.  Pick katas that interest you, this will help you power through.  

Along the way you'll learn about reading code, testing, using pseudocode, analyzing problem solving strategies, the JavaScript runtime execution, and much more.   

To guid you through this process we've created a template repository for you to fork - once for each exercise.  For each repo you fork and each Kata you complete, you will have to:
* Code you favorite solution
* Explain your solution: strategy & language features
* Write test cases, at least 10
* Write 2+ more solutions in pseudocde
* Analyze the solution of 3+ other Codewar Ninjas
* Write specs for you function
* Walk through your solution with 2+ different inputs
  * Pay special attention to this task
* Notes what you learned, what was hard, and what's next
* (you can do these in whatever order works best for you)


If this looks like a lot, that's because it is.  Studying fewer problems in greater depth (and from many different angles) will lead to better _skill transfer_, better self-knowledge, and more dexterity when dealing directly with sourcecode.  

Don't forget to build a gallery page for your Kata Repos and to feature it on your portfolio!

## Resources

Kata Repositories:
* [Template Repo](https://github.com/elewa-academy/exercise-template-repo).  You will need to fork and complete this repo for every kata you do.  These repos & live tests are what you will feature in your Codewar Gallery.
* [Demo Codewar Repo](https://github.com/elewa-student/String-Reverser).  You can use this as a reference for how to complete your repos.
