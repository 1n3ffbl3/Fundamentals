# Organizing Development

The purpose of this project is to introduce you to the skills needed to plan and carry out an organized development process.

When you're just learning and still building smaller projects by yourself, it can feel like a lot of extra work to plan your projects.  Especially when you can get them done faster and better just by winging it.  But as soon as you start working with someone else or building larger projects you'll quickly find it harder to keep track of what's going on.

Software and development are extremely complicated. It's humanly impossible to keep track of every corner of a large project, no matter how good you are.  Learning to plan and organize is incredibly hard if you can't visualize the whole project you're working on.

So take some time now while you're still building simple projects to practice planning.  If you learn this now you will have the mental tools necessary to look at large projects and break them into little projects, or "sprints", in your mind.  This skill will carry you farther faster than you expect.

## Requirements

Complete at least 5 User Centered [template repos](https://github.com/elewa-academy/User-Centered-Template/blob/master/README.md), build a gallery landing page to feature them all, and include this landing page on your portfolio.

When you're building your pages remember that the purpose of these projects is to __plan__ and __organize__ your development.  Don't worry about making your websites super pretty, or about using fancy libraries. There'll be plenty of time for that once you're organized!
