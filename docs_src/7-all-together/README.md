# Battle Ship

you've made it!  almost.  but you have learned the fundamentals of software development.  Take this oportunity to look back over everything you've learned so far, tying it all together in a final Fundamentals Project:  BATTLE SHIP, MAN VS MACHINE

You'll use everything you've learned so far to build this project:
* Story-based user centered development
* Story dependency and development scheduling
* Solution design
* Specs
* Testing
* Separation of Concerns
* Organization and presentation of src code

For this project you will receive only a set of functional and behavioral specifications.  It is your job to use everything you've learned this far to turn those specs into a working project in the most organized and consistent way you can.  

This project will be by far the largest project you have coded so far, but there is also nothing you have never seen before.  So long as you take it slow and keep organized, you should be able to find nearly everything you'll need in a project we've already built.

You are free to work alone or in small groups.

## Learning Objectives

* Managing larger projects
* Tracking your development process
* User/Logic interactions
* Front -> Back development
* Flow charts

### Front -> Back development

Following this process will help you build what you intended to build, keep track of your progress, and reinforce 3 key skills:
* User focus development
* Feature-based development
* 3 layered architecture

Here's how it works:
1. Plan your development process and get your HTML/CSS prepared. (There is more information on these steps in the template repo):
    a. Select user stories
    b. Analyze user story dependencies
    c. Choose a development schedule
    d. Build a wireframe
    e. Code the wireframe with HTML/CSS

2. Go through your development schedule one feature at a time.  For each feature you will complete these steps in this order:
    a. Make sure the HTML/CSS is in place to support this user story
    b. Write an event listener that responds to this user input
    c. Write the logic necessary to implement this user story
    d. Test the logic
    e. Call the logic in the event listener
    f. Test the user story in the browser by hand
    g. Save this version in a new folder
    h. Continue on to the next user story 

By the time you've finished every user story in your development schedule you should have a directory structure that looks something like this:
* User-Centered-Website
    * README
    * Tests

## Requirements

User stories (in no particular order)
- scramble these

A person can:

The application can:

0. see an empty board and a header  
1. place ships on board
2. hide ships and begin game
3. place guess on board
4. know if their guess was a hit or a miss
5. see their score after each guess
6. know when all ships are hit
7. know when a single ship is sunk

Technical specifications
- tests for your decision bots
- specs for you final code
- user instructions for how to play
- live demo on gh pages
- learning journal
- your dependency tree & dev schedule
- your wireframe

This looks like a lot to do, but if you use the development processes you learned over the last projects you should be making each of these things anyway.

A new thing: Git versions
- after you have completely implemented and tested a new user story you will place a git tag with the version number before moving on to your next user story.  This way users can easily check out past versions of your application.
