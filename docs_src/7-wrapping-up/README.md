# Battle Ship

you've made it!  almost.  but you have learned the fundamentals of software development.  Take this oportunity to look back over everything you've learned so far, tying it all together in a final Fundamentals Project:  BATTLE SHIP, MAN VS MACHINE

You'll use everything you've learned so far to build this project:
* Story-based user centered development
* Story dependency and development scheduling
* Solution design
* Specs
* Testing
* Separation of Concerns
* Organization and presentation of src code

For this project you will receive only a set of functional and behavioral specifications.  It is your job to use everything you've learned this far to turn those specs into a working project in the most organized and consistent way you can.  

You are free to work alone or in small groups.
