# The Buddy System

We advocate a less sever form of Pair Programming we like to call the Buddy System.  In the Buddy System you will pair up with at least one other person to complete each of the course projects.  

Pair Programming is a well-defined dynamic with set roles and procedures.  These roles work for some people, and can be very productive if both developers are more experienced.  But we've found that in the initial phases of learning it can be a lot to follow these rules __and__ figure out how everything works at the same time.  

So if you're interested in trying out true Pair Programming, go for it!  There is a good guide in the Resources section.  

If you prefer to work more freely with your Buddy, go for it!  Find a dynamic that works for both of you.

## Specifications


1. __Work on each project with a buddy or two__:
* How you work together or split up the project is your choice.  There is no single best way to do this, it will depend on your strengths and personalities.  What's important is that you are continuously engaging with another person while building these projects.  
2. __Daily peer assessments__:
* Take some time each day to answer each other's Study Journal quizzes.  Check your own knowledge & learn from your classmates.  But also give feedback (in person, as an issue, or as a pull request).  If a classmate made a mistake or didn't understand a topic let them know and explain how to improve.  If they wrote a very good quiz you can't figure out, ask them to help you work through it.
