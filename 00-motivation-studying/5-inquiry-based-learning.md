# Using Questions

> "Tell me and I forget, show me and I remember, involve me and I understand."

* Focus your study sessions by asking the right questions:
  1. Narrow & break down the topics you need to study.
    * Often in formulating a clear question you will find your answer.
  The best study questions are predictive and falsifiable
  3. By analyzing your list of questions, you can see:
     * Am I on topic?
       * If not am I distracted in breadth or depth?
     * What seem to be recurring questions? 
       * Can I trace those to a common source?
  4. If you do a good job organizing your questions you are also building up a study plan for the coming days or even weeks.


good study questions come in many forms:
      not open ended 
      predictive and falsifiable


What do I plan on doing with an answer to this question?

diversify your questions:
  100 chemists vs 10 + 90
    all working on one path
    or having 90 pounding away and 10 doing who knows what

metaquestions:
  why did i privilige x question?
  Does this question have a definitive answer? Will I know I have the right answer when I find it?
  Is this question in a reference class with other questions that led to important or significant answers?

good questions will come with bounds on answers:
  ie. i'm asking about how variables work, if i come accross the word 'hoising' i'll back off for now

levels of questions
  knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, evaluation
