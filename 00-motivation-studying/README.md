# Motivation & Studying

Sometimes the hardest part of learning to code is keeping at it.  There will be times when it feels like no matter what you try, you stay stuck.  It's at these worst-of-times that it's most important to keep your spirits up, and make the most of every minute you spend studying.

Fortunately both motivation _and_ studying are skills you can improve!

# [Find Your Why](http://elewa.education/2018/02/08/setting-your-goals/)

learning to code is hard, takes a lot of time, and will continually challenge you.  If you ever feel like you've got it all under control, you're not doing it right!  To push through this you need to really know why.

It's not important where your motivation comes from.  Maybe you have a natural aptitude you want to explore, or your friends all develop and you want to be part of that, or it's your best shot at a better life. Or maybe you just love to program.  No matter what your _why_ is, you need to feel it and remind yourself when the going gets tough.

We recommend writing a personal mission statement for learning to code and putting it somewhere visible like in your GitHub bio, your portfolio, your bathroom mirror, your computer background, or tattooed on your forehead.


4 hours into a debug when you find a comma instead of a semi-colon, it can be hard to remember what you were thinking when you started down this road.  Remind yourself: 
* Programming is the _what_
* Studying & practice is the _how_ 
* And your _why_ is what brought you here in the first place!

# Manage Your Mindset

Given the right opportunities and environment, humans learn. [It's just what we do](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/learning-natural-human-tendency-andrew-johnson/).  We can't help it!

But it can be very easy to get in your own way.  Especially when you're learning something inherently challenging like software development.  To maximize your learning it helps to keep a healthy mindset.  

From our experience successful students:

1. Have a Growth Mindset:
  * [Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75GFzikmRY0)
  * [Programming & Growth Mindset](https://www.digitaladventures.com/news/2016/5/2/how-learning-to-code-can-help-develop-a-growth-mindset)

2. Live in the Learning Zone:
  * [The Video](http://www.totalimmersion.net/blog/get-better-things-care-practice-learning-zone/)
  * [Balancing the Two](http://jonathanreeve.com.au/blog/2017/10/13/balancing-learning-and-performance)

3. Embracing Confusion:
  * [Good & Bad Confusion](https://theconversation.com/confused-dont-worry-because-that-can-be-a-good-thing-64421)
  * [Necessary to Learning](https://quantumprogress.wordpress.com/2011/04/22/embracing-confusion-as-a-necessary-part-of-learning-part-1/)
  * [Uncertainty is Inevitable](https://towardsmaturity.org/2017/04/12/learning-uncertainty-cope/)
 
Using these three mindsets is a skill.  They often don't come naturally but with practice you can learn to apply them effectively to every challenge you will face.  When you feel like you can't keep them up any longer push through!  Your ability to maintain these perspectives will grow the longer you try.

# Stay Motivated

Motivation is a tricky thing, it can come and go seemingly without any reason.  You can't _always_ control this - life happens. But there are certain steps you can take to loose motivation less frequently and to bounce back faster.
* Remind yourself __why__ you are doing this painful thing.
* Like what you're working on:
  * There are as many ways to be a developer as there are paths to get there. If what you're working on isn't helping your motivation, shake it up a little.  Choose a different project or approach that still moves you forward.
* Lean on your community:
  * If it's a friend next door or a chat buddy across the world, having someone to talk through your code or your struggles will make it easier to master that skill and move on.  You each have different strengths.  Learn to use your team-mates!
* Take a break!
  * More often than not you can make everything better by calling it early and getting a good night's sleep.  The next day your code _and_ your motivation will be better than before.

# Manage Your Expectations

A key to staying motivated is having realistic expectations.  The first expectation you should set is that you will not be able to predict how fast or well you will learn anything.  The skills necessary to be a great programmer are incredibly diverse, some will come naturally and others will not.  It's simply not possible for you to predict how this will play out in your particular experience.

Software development is an incredibly complex skill.  It requires communication, inter-personal skills, technical skills, contextual awareness, planning and  accurate self-knowledge to name just a few.  While any single one of these skills may not be complicated, the way they interact in a live development process is complicated and unpredictable.  

No matter how smart you are, or how well you can learn other tasks, this inherent complexity will make it nearly impossible for you to predict when and how you will struggle.  Embrace this!  It's fun once you get used to it.

## Being Wrong

You will be wrong every day you write code.  There are many great reasons for this and none of them have to do with you personally, here's a few:
* __Software Development is incredibly complicated.__  There's basically no one out there that can hold every detail of a production application in their minds.
* __You are working collaboratively.__ You may know what _should_ be happening, but that's no guarantee it _does_ work that way! Errors and miscommunications will happen. 
* __Every language feature, tool, and library you use was designed by another human.__ There is often no way to guess how something works, you need to read their documentation.  And documentation isn't always clear or correct perfect.
* __You are never doing the same task twice.__  Every time you sit down to write some code, you are approaching a brand new problem with tools that are always changing.  No one can be right every time about something they've never seen before.

You should seek out being wrong, always look for how you are wrong not how you are right. This is how you will break your knowledge and reconstruct it stronger than before.  Embrace the fails!

If you are cruising along building projects with no problems, being right all the time, you're missing the point.  Studying and learning isn't about repeating what you understand, it's about finding the weaknesses in your understanding and correcting them.

# Help Your Brain

Effective learning is (_very_ roughly) built of these main pieces:
* Concentrated and intentional effort
* Accurate meta-cognition (being aware of your own mental processes)
* Cognitive Load management (more on this in a moment)
* Forming & maintaining useful mental models

Some of this you have direct control over and some you don't.  Effective learning will happen once you've learned how to improve what you can control and manage what you can't.  


* __Accurate Meta-Cognition__:
  * This is possibly the most important of all 4 points.  Self-learning is also self-teaching, to be able to teach someone you need to know their strengths and weaknesses. Accurately assessing your your abilities (positive and negative) will make all the difference. This applies to practical coding skills - knowing what to practice and what to learn next. 
  And even more importantly it applies to knowing your own state of mind: When are you unsure vs. lost? Are you losing focus? Does your confidence match your abilities? 
  * [Tips for Improving](http://www.learningscientists.org/blog/2017/3/30-1).  This article is about understanding texts, but everything they say applies just as much to understanding source code.

* __Concentrated and Intentional Effort__:
  * You will learn most effectively when you are deliberate about every action you take - have a reason and a success measure for everything you study.  "Going through the motions" for the sake of repetition is not an efficient way to improve in the long-run.  
  * [Practicing Deliberate Practice](https://medium.com/the-crossover-cast/get-better-at-anything-6-steps-of-deliberate-practice-19830bfc9460)

* __Cognitive Load Management__:
  * _Cognitive Load_ is the amount of incoming information your brain has to handle at once.  Managing this is so important for learning because you most effectively learn information that has been fully processed by your working memory. If your brain is attempting to process more than it can handle, none of the incoming information can be handled correctly.  
  Your goal shouldn't be to completely remove cognitive load, but rather to make sure you are experiencing the right type:
    * _Intrinsic Load_:  This refers to the inherent complexity of what you are trying to learn.  Programming is a very complex skill.  The best way to limit intrinsic load is to study projects that introduce only one new concept at a time, building on what you have already completed. We have done our best to build this principle into our curriculum.
    * _Extraneous Load_:  This is anything unrelated the concept you are trying to learn.   There are certain things that will always fall into this category - background noise, phones, this weekend's plans.  Then there are some things that can be extraneous _or_ intrinsic - new language features, dev tools, frameworks, ... It is up to you to decide what you're focusing on and to learn the rest later.
    * _Germane Load_:  This is the good one, you want this one.  Germane load is the work your brain does that translates directly into meaningful learning.  After you've cleared away distractions, set your concentration, and decided on narrow learning objectives, this is the work your brain has left to do: convert new information into usable mental models.  You can think of it a bit like switching to a more fuel-efficient car - you burn the same amount of gas but move further and faster.
  * [Great Overview of Cognitive Load](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/cognitive-load-theory.htm)


* __Forming & Maintaining Quality Mental Models__:
  * A sign of effective learning is __automatization__ - that lovely moment where you no longer need to _think_ to complete a task.  You can talk or eat without thinking about the muscles in your mouth, and if you do try to think about them it gets harder!  This is automatization in action.  Your brain has built a network of Mental Models that it can fall back on to carry out these routine tasks without increasing your cognitive load.
  Your brain automatically builds these models as you interact with the world.  This means you don't have to _try_ to learn.  But it also means you have to be very careful about what how you study. Because programming is so complex, it is possible to understand it in many different ways.  An incorrect model might work for a while, but will ultimately stop you in your tracks when you reach something that works differently from what you understand. Unlearning these automated through process is much more difficult than learning them correctly from the beginning.
  Fortunately there are some very simple steps you can take to overcome this challenge: 
    * Explain everything back to yourself.
    * Draw diagrams of how you think things work, and try to apply them to real-life scenarios.
    * Ask for help early and often, even when you think you understand something.  Catch mistakes before they settle in.
  * [What are Mental Models?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K_sxBUGx8A)
  * [Make a Concept Map](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Concept-Map)


In short, your brain wants to learn.  Give it a chance by working with it not against it.

# Study Effectively


"Studying".  Such a common word that it can be hard to know what it really means.  At Elewa we use a very simple and actionable definition.

> __Studying__: Managing your limited resources to maximize learning.

* "There is only so much time in a day."
* "I can't focus today."
* "I'm burnt out."
* "I just don't care anymore."
* "Figure it out yourself this time."
* "It's too hard."
* "I can't stay awake."

Each of these common complaints hint that some resource has run out.  Time, motivation, concentration, social support, thinking power, energy, all of these are necessary to maximize learning and all of them can be used up.

There is no single best way to study, everyone has their own unique limitations they need to balance.  A busy parent will have a very different balancing act than a full-time student, or a single lawyer.  The first step to effective studying is to know your own situation.  Do you run out time before motivation?  Do you stay motivated well after you can't think straight anymore?  Do you have perfect discipline, but still learn slower than your peers? Each of these cases will require a different strategy, and only you can figure out your own strategy.  It can be tricky but with enough reflection, trial, and error you can make it.

Here are some tips to get the most out of your available resources:
* __Time__:
* __Motivation__:
  * Keep it light and fun.
* __[Working Memory](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/working-memory-how-you-keep-things-ldquo-in-mind-rdquo-over-the-short-term/)__:
  * multi-tasking vs task-switching
* __Social Support__:
* __

use "external memory": mneumonics, diagrams, good habits, 




  1. Keep your working memory clear - 
    * Let clear code, good habits, and careful planning do the hard work for you.
  2. Don't try working on anything you can't hold in your head all at once -
    * If you find there's too much going on for you to keep straight, you probably did a bad job with # 1.


"learning styles" is over-rated. You will generally get better _skill transfer_ if you learn a new concept in it's real-life context.  ie. codepen vs browser/terminal/editor.  It may feel less effective at first, but the long-term rewards are greater.  Transition over as soon as you can.


TL;DR - 
0. Keep it light and fun.

  learning style be damned.  learn in the real context

By asking the right questions:
  Narrow the topics you need to study.
  Often, in formulating a clear question you will find your answer.
  Analyzing your list of questions, you can see:
    Am I on topic?
      Am I distracted in breadth or depth?
    What seem to be recurring confusions? 
      Can I trace those to a common source?
  Automatically building up a study plan for the next days.
    If you do a good job organizing your questions.
