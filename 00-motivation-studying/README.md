# [Find Your Why](http://elewa.education/2018/02/08/setting-your-goals/)

learning to code is hard, takes a lot of time, and will continually challenge you.  If you ever feel like you've got it all under control, you're not doing it right!  To push through this you need to really know why.

It's not important where your motivation comes from.  Maybe you have a natural aptitude you want to explore, or your friends all develop and you want to be part of that, or it's your best shot at a better life. Or maybe you just love to program.  No matter what your _why_ is, you need to feel it and remind yourself when the going gets tough.

We recommend writing a personal mission statement for learning to code and putting it somewhere visible like in your GitHub bio, your portfolio, your bathroom mirror, your computer background, or tattooed on your forehead.


4 hours into a debug when you find a comma instead of a semi-colon, it can be hard to remember what you were thinking when you started down this road.  Remind yourself: 
* Programming is the _what_
* Studying & practice is the _how_ 
* And your _why_ is what brought you here in the first place!

# Manage Your Mindset

Given the right environment, humans learn. It's just what we do.  We can't help it!

However, it can be very easy to get in your own way when you're learning something inherently challenging like software development.
