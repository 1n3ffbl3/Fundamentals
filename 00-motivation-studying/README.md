# Study Journal

Of all the skills you will need as a developer, effective learning is __the most important__.  There is no library, no framework, no buzzword you can master that will serve you better than strong study and learning habits.  Journaling about your studies is an outstanding way to develop those skills.

Often the hardest part of learning to code is keeping at it.  It will feel like no matter what you try, you stay stuck.  This is totally normal.  It's at these most de-motivating moments that it's important to keep your spirits up, keep your eye on the prize, and remind yourself why you love to code.

Fortunately both motivation _and_ studying are skills you can improve!
