# Motivation & Studying

Quality learning relies on motivation and effective studying.  

Fortunately for us _both_ of those skills can be practiced and improved!

# [Find Your Why](http://elewa.education/2018/02/08/setting-your-goals/)

learning to code is hard, takes a lot of time, and will continually challenge you.  If you ever feel like you've got it all under control, you're not doing it right!  To push through this you need to really know why.

It's not important where your motivation comes from.  Maybe you have a natural aptitude you want to explore, or your friends all develop and you want to be part of that, or it's your best shot at a better life. Or maybe you just love to program.  No matter what your _why_ is, you need to feel it and remind yourself when the going gets tough.

We recommend writing a personal mission statement for learning to code and putting it somewhere visible like in your GitHub bio, your portfolio, your bathroom mirror, your computer background, or tattooed on your forehead.


4 hours into a debug when you find a comma instead of a semi-colon, it can be hard to remember what you were thinking when you started down this road.  Remind yourself: 
* Programming is the _what_
* Studying & practice is the _how_ 
* And your _why_ is what brought you here in the first place!

# Manage Your Mindset

Given the right opportunities and environment, humans learn. [It's just what we do](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/learning-natural-human-tendency-andrew-johnson/).  We can't help it!

But it can be very easy to get in your own way.  Especially when you're learning something inherently challenging like software development.  To maximize your learning it helps to keep a healthy mindset.  

From our experience successful students:

1. Have a Growth Mindset:

  * [Programming & Growth Mindset](https://www.digitaladventures.com/news/2016/5/2/how-learning-to-code-can-help-develop-a-growth-mindset)

2. Live in the Learning Zone:
  * [The Video](http://www.totalimmersion.net/blog/get-better-things-care-practice-learning-zone/)
  * [Balancing the Two](http://jonathanreeve.com.au/blog/2017/10/13/balancing-learning-and-performance)

3. Embracing Confusion:
  * [Good & Bad Confusion](https://theconversation.com/confused-dont-worry-because-that-can-be-a-good-thing-64421)
  * [Necessary to Learning](https://quantumprogress.wordpress.com/2011/04/22/embracing-confusion-as-a-necessary-part-of-learning-part-1/)
  * [Uncertainty is Inevitable](https://towardsmaturity.org/2017/04/12/learning-uncertainty-cope/)
 
Using these three mindsets is a skill.  They often don't come naturally but with practice you can learn to apply them effectively to every challenge you will face.  When you feel like you can't keep them up any longer push through!  Your ability to maintain these perspectives will grow the longer you try.

# Stay Motivated

Motivation is a tricky thing, it can come and go seemingly without any reason.  You can't _always_ control this - life happens. But there are certain steps you can take to loose motivation less frequently and to bounce back faster.
* Remind yourself __why__ you are doing this painful thing.
* Like what you're working on:
  * There are as many ways to be a developer as there are paths to get there. If what you're working on isn't helping your motivation, shake it up a little.  Choose a different project or approach that still moves you forward.
* Lean on your community:
  * If it's a friend next door or a chat buddy across the world, having someone to talk through your code or your struggles will make it easier to master that skill and move on.  You each have different strengths.  Learn to use your team-mates!
* Take a break!
  * More often than not you can make everything better by calling it early and getting a good night's sleep.  The next day your code _and_ your motivation will be better than before.

# Manage Your Expectations

A key to staying motivated is having realistic expectations.  The first expectation you should set is that you will not be able to predict how fast or well you will learn anything.  The skills necessary to be a great programmer are incredibly diverse, some will come naturally and others will not.  It's simply not possible for you to predict how this will play out in your particular experience.

Software development is an incredibly complex skill.  It requires communication, inter-personal skills, technical skills, contextual awareness, planning and  accurate self-knowledge to name just a few.  While any single one of these skills may not be complicated, the way they interact in a live development process is complicated and unpredictable.  

No matter how smart you are, or how well you can learn other tasks, this inherent complexity will make it nearly impossible for you to predict when and how you will struggle.  Embrace this!  It's fun once you get used to it.

# Cognitive Resources

Effective learning is composed (_very_ roughly) of these main components:
* Concentrated and intentional effort
* Accurate meta-cognition (being aware of your own mental processes)
* Cognitive Load management
* Formation of useful mental models

If this weren't already a lot, each of these components has a conscious and an unconscious side.  

* a little science
  * memory - working, longterm, schemas/mental models
  * cognitive load - pull from english to js
  * mental models
  * metacognition - it sucks. teach people
  * some cognitive falacies & shortcomings
    * the two named one yanss talks about

# Study Effectively

now you're motivated. now how to get the most out of your time studying.

let's tackle effective studying from a few perspectives:
* Management of limited resources
* Teaching yourself something you don't know
* Asking the right questions

Good studying is effectively managing your resources:
* time
* motivation
* mental
  1. Keep your working memory clear - 
    * Let clear code, good habits, and careful planning do the hard work for you.
  2. Don't try working on anything you can't hold in your head all at once -
    * If you find there's too much going on for you to keep straight, you probably did a bad job with # 1.

The key skill ties this all together is self-knowledge.



TL;DR - 
0. Keep it light and fun.



By asking the right questions:
  Narrow the topics you need to study.
  Often, in formulating a clear question you will find your answer.
  Analyzing your list of questions, you can see:
    Am I on topic?
      Am I distracted in breadth or depth?
    What seem to be recurring confusions? 
      Can I trace those to a common source?
  Automatically building up a study plan for the next days.
    If you do a good job organizing your questions.

Studying seems simple, you sit there and learn stuff.  But thatâ€™s far from true.
  Good studying is teaching yourself. 
  Good studying requires a good plan.
  Good study plans look a lot like lesson plans.
  Good lesson plans have a focus and end product
  A focus is not only a topic and some skills, but specifies scope and levels of detail.
