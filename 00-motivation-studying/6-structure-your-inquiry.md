# Structure Your Inquiry

> "Tell me and I forget, show me and I remember, involve me and I understand."

Learning is a an active verb, it's the result of engaging and experimenting with your environment.  Forming and exploring the right questions is our favorite way of interacting with new challenges.

## Be Curious

Questions only matter if you try to find the answer. Writing them down isn't enough.  To get the most out of Inquiry-Based Learning you'll have to ask questions you care about, trying to find answers that interest you. 

Staying curious ties in very closely with motivation.  Remember why you're learning to program, tweak your projects so they interest you, don't stick stubbornly to a project that's going nowhere, ... there's an endless list of reasons to stop stop being intrigued by what you're working on.  

At the end of the day, staying curious is a personal thing.  You'll have to experiment and figure out what works for you.

## Be Playful

Your mindset makes all the difference.  Even with the best study questions (and unlimited curiosity) you will have a hard time moving forward if studying feels like work.  Of course studying will be hard, will take dedication, and won't always feel productive, but that doesn't mean you can't have fun with it!  

Turn everything you do into a little bit of a game, puzzle, or work of art. See how many times you can make yourself smile, even if means you have to laugh at yourself for trying.

## Be Cautious

Unguided inquiry is dangerous to meaningful learning. It's very easy to ...
* ... learn incorrect habits and processes.  What sets apart expert from novice programmers isn't an encyclopedic list of facts, it's the good habits and intuitions they have accumulated through years of quality experience.  Learning with no guidance can either delay or actively work against building efficient habits & processes.
* ... learn plausible but incorrect mental models.  You won't notice when the challenges are simple, but you will crash and burn later when the challenges become harder and your incorrect understanding is no longer enough.
* ... completely miss the point.  Learning wonderful, correct, new concepts that have nothing to do with what you're supposed to learn will set you back for a long time as you struggle to catch back up.

Any of these mistakes will doubly waste your efforts. First when you learned the wrong thing, and again when you have to get yourself back on track.

To get the most form our curriculum we highly recommend you carefully follow every project spec, and completely fill out every project template - even when it feels slow or un-important.  They are carefully designed to guide you through the _processes_ of being a good developer,  it's more important _how_ you complete these projects than what they look like at the end.

## Be Deliberate

Not all questions are created equal.  Whenever something pops into your head, take a moment to refactor it into something meaningful before diving in head first.

### Find the best way to phrase your question:
* Predictive & Falsifiable?
  * It will print {name: "Kelly"}.
  * This variable will change 4 times.
* Multiple Choice?
* Open-Ended?
* True/False?


### Constrain your exploration:
* "If I come across hoisting I'll back off"
* "After 5 minutes I'm moving on"
* "I don't need to understand this concept yet, just use it"
* "I'll only read code to find my answer, not words"

### Identify the level of understanding you're dealing with:
* 

### Ask Meta-Questions:
* Why do I 


metaquestions:
  why did i privilige x question?
  Does this question have a definitive answer? Will I know I have the right answer when I find it?
  Is this question in a reference class with other questions that led to important or significant answers?



levels of questions
  knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, evaluation

## Be Strategic

Organize your questions into a 

What do I plan on doing with an answer to this question?

diversify your questions:
  100 chemists vs 10 + 90
    all working on one path
    or having 90 pounding away and 10 doing who knows what


* Focus your study sessions by asking the right questions:
  1. Narrow & break down the topics you need to study.
    * Often in formulating a clear question you will find your answer.
  The best study questions are predictive and falsifiable
  3. By analyzing your list of questions, you can see:
     * Am I on topic?
       * If not am I distracted in breadth or depth?
     * What seem to be recurring questions? 
       * Can I trace those to a common source?
  4. If you do a good job organizing your questions you are also building up a study plan for the coming days or even weeks.
